# School Days Plus Auto-Entry

This folder contains the automation tools for entering student data.

## Initial Setup (Do this once)

1.  **Install Python**:
    -   If I haven't been able to install it for you, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    -   **IMPORTANT**: Check the box **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

2.  **Install Libraries**:
    -   Double-click [0_Install_Dependencies.bat]
    -   Wait for it to say "Requirements installed successfully!".

## How to Use

### Step 1: Teach the Robot (Run Once)
1.  Open **School Days Plus**.
2.  Double-click [1_Setup_Wizard.bat]
3.  Follow the instructions on the black screen. Use your mouse to point at the buttons it asks for, and press **ENTER** on your keyboard to save the spot.

### Step 2: Run the Automation
1.  Make sure your Excel file is in this folder. It can have any name, but there should only be one `.xlsx` file.
2.  Make sure **School Days Plus** is open and in the **EXACT SAME POSITION** as step 1.
3.  Double-click [2_Run_Automation.bat]
4.  Sit back and watch! To stop it immediately, move your mouse to any corner of the screen.

## Troubleshooting
-   **"Python not found"**: Re-install Python and MAKE SURE to check "Add Python to PATH".
-   **Clicking the wrong spot**: The window moved. Run [1_Setup_Wizard.bat] again.
