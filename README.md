## Initial Setup (Do this once)

1.  **Install Libraries**:
    -   Double-click [0_Install_Dependencies.bat]
    -   Wait for it to say "Requirements installed successfully!".

## How to Use

### Step 1: Teach the Robot (Run Once)
1.  Open **School Days Plus**.
2.  Double-click [1_Setup_Wizard.bat]
3.  Follow the instructions on the black screen. Use your mouse to point at the buttons it asks for, and press **ENTER** on your keyboard to save the spot.

### Step 2: Run the Automation
1.  Make sure your Excel file is in this folder. It can have any name, but there should only be one `.xlsx` file.
2.  Make sure **School Days Plus** is open and in the **EXACT SAME POSITION** as step 1.
