# School Days Plus Auto-Entry

This folder contains the automation tools for entering student data.

## Initial Setup (Do this once)

1.  **Install Libraries**:
    -   Double-click [0_Install_Dependencies.bat]
    -   Wait for it to say "Requirements installed successfully!".

## How to Use

### Step 1: Teach the Robot and Run the Automation
1.  Open **School Days Plus**.
2.  Make sure only one excel file exists inside of the same folder as [Run_Schooldays_Automation_Yearbook_Photo_Choice.bat]. It can exist in any other folder (including the child folders), but not in the same folder as the .bat file.
3.  Double-click [Run_Schooldays_Automation_Yearbook_Photo_Choice.bat]
4.  Follow the instructions on the black screen. Use your mouse to point at the buttons it asks for, and press **ENTER** on your keyboard to save the input spots.
5. Sit back and watch! To stop it immediately, move your mouse to any corner of the screen.
6. Program will notify you of the end of the process. You can press any key to escape or click "x" on the window when done.

## Troubleshooting
-   **Clicking the wrong spot**: The window moved. Run [Run_Schooldays_Automation_Yearbook_Photo_Choice.bat] again.
